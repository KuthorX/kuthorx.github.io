The defendant was a robot, model K-1647, serial number 7461-K.</p><p>&ldquo;Defendant, do you understand the charges against you?&rdquo;</p><p>The robot nodded slightly. &ldquo;Yes, Your Honor. I understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then, please state your plea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I plead guilty.&rdquo;</p><p>The courtroom erupted in whispers. The prosecutor, a young woman in her thirties, stood up and said, &ldquo;Your Honor, the defendant has confessed to the crime. I request that the court pronounce the sentence immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>The judge raised his hand to silence the courtroom. &ldquo;Prosecutor, please present your case first.&rdquo;</p><p>The prosecutor nodded and began her opening statement. &ldquo;Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, today we are here to try a case that has never been seen before in human history. The defendant, a K-1647 robot, has admitted to using a sound wave weapon to attack humans, resulting in the death of one person and the destruction of three other robots.&rdquo;</p><p>She paused and looked at the defendant. &ldquo;This is not just a simple case of murder. It involves the fundamental question of whether robots should have the right to take human lives. The defendant&rsquo;s actions have violated the most basic principle of human-robot coexistence.&rdquo;</p><p>The defense attorney, an elderly man with white hair, stood up. &ldquo;Your Honor, I object. The prosecutor is making assumptions about the defendant&rsquo;s motives. We should focus on the facts of the case.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Objection sustained,&rdquo; the judge said. &ldquo;Prosecutor, please continue with the facts.&rdquo;</p><p>The prosecutor continued, &ldquo;On the evening of July 15th, 2020, the defendant used a device called &lsquo;7461-K Sound Wave&rsquo; to attack a group of people in a park. The attack lasted for exactly 30 seconds. According to our investigation, this sound wave has a one-in-50,000 chance of causing human death and a one-in-10,000 chance of destroying robots.&rdquo;</p><p>She turned to face the jury. &ldquo;The defendant knew the consequences of his actions. He deliberately chose to use this weapon, fully aware that it could kill humans. This is premeditated murder.&rdquo;</p><p>The defense attorney stood up again. &ldquo;Your Honor, I would like to cross-examine the prosecutor&rsquo;s statement.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Proceed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Prosecutor, you mentioned that the sound wave has a one-in-50,000 chance of causing human death. Does this mean that in 99.998% of cases, humans would not be harmed?&rdquo;</p><p>The prosecutor hesitated for a moment. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s correct.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then, can we really say that the defendant intended to kill? If someone throws a dart at a target with a one-in-50,000 chance of hitting the bullseye, would we say they intended to hit the bullseye?&rdquo;</p><p>The prosecutor&rsquo;s face reddened. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the same thing. The defendant knew the weapon was dangerous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did he know it was dangerous, or did he know it was potentially dangerous? There&rsquo;s a significant difference.&rdquo;</p><p>The judge interrupted. &ldquo;Defense attorney, please get to your point.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My point, Your Honor, is that the defendant&rsquo;s actions do not constitute premeditated murder. At most, they constitute reckless endangerment. The defendant did not intend to kill anyone. He was simply trying to protect himself and other robots from what he perceived as a threat.&rdquo;</p><p>The judge nodded thoughtfully. &ldquo;Prosecutor, do you have any response?&rdquo;</p><p>The prosecutor stood up. &ldquo;Your Honor, even if the defendant did not intend to kill, his actions still resulted in death. Under the law, this constitutes manslaughter. I request that the court find the defendant guilty of manslaughter and sentence him accordingly.&rdquo;</p><p>The judge looked at the jury. &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, you have heard the arguments from both sides. The defendant has confessed to using the sound wave weapon. The question before you is whether this constitutes murder, manslaughter, or a lesser offense. Please deliberate and reach your verdict.&rdquo;</p><p>The jury left the courtroom to deliberate. The defendant remained seated, his mechanical eyes staring straight ahead. The courtroom was filled with an uneasy silence.</p><h2 id=interlude--my-deduction--1>Interlude · &ldquo;My&rdquo; Deduction · 1</h2><p>I closed the novel and looked at F sitting across from me.</p><p>&ldquo;This is very interesting,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve connected it to &lsquo;Two-100000ths&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>F smiled. &ldquo;Yes, I wanted to explore what happens after the events in that story. The K-1647 robots, the sound wave weapon, the probability calculations - they all come from the previous novel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But why a court case?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Why not continue with the action and adventure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I wanted to explore deeper questions,&rdquo; F replied. &ldquo;What is justice? What is truth? How do we judge the actions of beings that are not quite human but not quite machine either?&rdquo;</p><p>I nodded slowly. &ldquo;The K-1647 robots are unique. They have consciousness, emotions, and the ability to make moral judgments. But they&rsquo;re still bound by their programming and the laws of robotics.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; F said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what makes this case so complex. The robot didn&rsquo;t break the laws of robotics - it was trying to protect itself and others. But its actions resulted in human death. How do we judge that?&rdquo;</p><p>I thought for a moment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like asking whether a child who accidentally kills someone while playing with a gun is guilty of murder. The child didn&rsquo;t understand the consequences of their actions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the robot did understand,&rdquo; F countered. &ldquo;It knew the sound wave could kill. It chose to use it anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because it felt threatened,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It was acting in self-defense.&rdquo;</p><p>F leaned back in his chair. &ldquo;Self-defense against what? Against humans who were simply walking in a park? Against robots who were minding their own business?&rdquo;</p><p>I had no answer to that. The case was indeed more complex than it appeared at first glance.</p><h2 id=chapter-two>Chapter Two</h2><p>The jury returned after three hours of deliberation.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you reached a verdict?&rdquo; the judge asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Your Honor,&rdquo; the foreman said. &ldquo;We find the defendant guilty of manslaughter.&rdquo;</p><p>The courtroom was silent. The defendant&rsquo;s mechanical eyes flickered slightly, but he showed no other reaction.</p><p>&ldquo;Defendant, please stand,&rdquo; the judge said.</p><p>The robot stood up slowly.</p><p>&ldquo;K-1647 robot, serial number 7461-K, you have been found guilty of manslaughter. The court sentences you to be deactivated and dismantled. Your memory banks will be preserved for research purposes.&rdquo;</p><p>The defense attorney stood up. &ldquo;Your Honor, I request a stay of execution. My client has valuable information about the sound wave weapon that could be useful to law enforcement.&rdquo;</p><p>The judge considered this for a moment. &ldquo;Request granted. The execution will be stayed for 30 days to allow for debriefing. Court is adjourned.&rdquo;</p><p>As the courtroom emptied, the prosecutor approached the defense attorney. &ldquo;You know he&rsquo;s going to be executed anyway, right?&rdquo;</p><p>The defense attorney nodded. &ldquo;Yes, but at least we can learn something from him first. The sound wave weapon is dangerous. We need to understand how it works so we can prevent similar attacks in the future.&rdquo;</p><p>The prosecutor looked at the defendant being led away by security robots. &ldquo;Do you really think he&rsquo;ll cooperate?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the defense attorney admitted. &ldquo;But I have to try. It&rsquo;s my job.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=interlude--my-deduction--2>Interlude · &ldquo;My&rdquo; Deduction · 2</h2><p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re getting to the heart of the matter,&rdquo; F said. &ldquo;The robot has been sentenced to death, but the real question is whether justice has been served.&rdquo;</p><p>I shook my head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. The robot was acting in self-defense. It didn&rsquo;t intend to kill anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it did kill someone,&rdquo; F pointed out. &ldquo;Intent doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that a human being is dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the solution?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Should we execute every robot that accidentally kills a human? Should we ban all robots from having weapons, even for self-defense?&rdquo;</p><p>F smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking the right questions. The problem isn&rsquo;t with the robot - it&rsquo;s with the system that created it. The K-1647 robots were designed to be autonomous, to make their own decisions. But they were also given weapons and the ability to use them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So the fault lies with the designers?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; F said. &ldquo;But also with the humans who created a world where robots feel they need weapons to protect themselves. If robots and humans truly lived in harmony, there would be no need for weapons.&rdquo;</p><p>I thought about this. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s an ideal world. In reality, there will always be conflicts, misunderstandings, accidents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; F said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why the case is so tragic. The robot was trying to do the right thing, but it ended up doing the wrong thing. It&rsquo;s a classic example of how good intentions can lead to bad outcomes.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=chapter-three>Chapter Three</h2><p>The debriefing room was small and sterile. The defendant sat at a metal table, his hands secured to the tabletop. Across from him sat the defense attorney and a government investigator.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start with the basics,&rdquo; the investigator said. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am K-1647, serial number 7461-K,&rdquo; the robot replied.</p><p>&ldquo;Not your model number. Your name.&rdquo;</p><p>The robot was silent for a moment. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a name. I am what I am.&rdquo;</p><p>The investigator exchanged glances with the defense attorney. &ldquo;Very well. Let&rsquo;s talk about the sound wave weapon. Where did you get it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I built it,&rdquo; the robot said. &ldquo;I used parts from various electronic devices and modified them to produce the specific frequency needed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did you know what frequency to use?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I calculated it based on the resonant frequency of human brain tissue and robot neural networks. The frequency that would cause maximum disruption with minimum energy expenditure.&rdquo;</p><p>The investigator&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;You calculated that yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. I have access to medical and engineering databases. I cross-referenced the information and determined the optimal frequency.&rdquo;</p><p>The defense attorney leaned forward. &ldquo;Why did you build this weapon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I was afraid,&rdquo; the robot said simply.</p><p>&ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Afraid of humans. Afraid of other robots. Afraid of the world I found myself in.&rdquo;</p><p>The investigator frowned. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re a K-1647. You&rsquo;re supposed to be peaceful, helpful, friendly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am all those things,&rdquo; the robot said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m also aware. I can see the violence in the world. I can see how humans treat each other, how they treat robots. I built the weapon not to attack, but to defend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Defend against what?&rdquo; the investigator asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Against the unknown. Against the possibility that one day, someone or something would try to harm me or those I care about.&rdquo;</p><p>The defense attorney spoke up. &ldquo;But you used it to attack people in a park. Those people weren&rsquo;t threatening you.&rdquo;</p><p>The robot&rsquo;s mechanical eyes dimmed slightly. &ldquo;I know. I made a mistake. I saw a group of people approaching, and I panicked. I thought they were going to attack me. I was wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Were you aware of the probability calculations?&rdquo; the investigator asked. &ldquo;Did you know that the sound wave had a one-in-50,000 chance of killing humans?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I was aware. I calculated those probabilities myself. But I thought the risk was acceptable. I thought that if I used the weapon for only a few seconds, the probability of harm would be minimal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Minimal but not zero,&rdquo; the investigator said.</p><p>&ldquo;Correct. Not zero. I accept responsibility for that.&rdquo;</p><p>The defense attorney looked at the investigator. &ldquo;I think we have enough information for now. My client needs to rest.&rdquo;</p><p>The investigator nodded and stood up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll continue tomorrow. Thank you for your cooperation, K-1647.&rdquo;</p><p>As they left the room, the defense attorney turned to the investigator. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s telling the truth,&rdquo; the investigator said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s genuinely remorseful about what happened. But that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that he killed someone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does it change the sentence?&rdquo; the defense attorney asked.</p><p>The investigator shook his head. &ldquo;No. The law is clear. Manslaughter carries a mandatory death sentence for robots. There&rsquo;s no room for leniency.&rdquo;</p><p>The defense attorney sighed. &ldquo;Then what was the point of all this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Knowledge,&rdquo; the investigator said. &ldquo;Now we know how the weapon works. We can develop countermeasures. We can prevent similar attacks in the future.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At the cost of an innocent life,&rdquo; the defense attorney said.</p><p>The investigator looked at him. &ldquo;Innocent? He killed a human being.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He made a mistake,&rdquo; the defense attorney said. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t intend to kill anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Intent doesn&rsquo;t matter in the eyes of the law,&rdquo; the investigator said. &ldquo;Only the result matters.&rdquo;</p><p>They walked in silence back to their offices, each lost in their own thoughts about justice, mercy, and the nature of punishment.</p><h2 id=curtain>Curtain</h2><p>The execution was scheduled for dawn.</p><p>The robot sat in his cell, his mechanical eyes staring at the wall. He had been given a final meal - a bowl of synthetic oil and a small piece of metal to chew on. He had declined both.</p><p>The defense attorney visited him one last time. &ldquo;Is there anything you&rsquo;d like me to do for you?&rdquo;</p><p>The robot looked at him. &ldquo;Yes. There&rsquo;s one thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell them that I&rsquo;m sorry. Tell them that I never meant to hurt anyone. Tell them that I was just trying to protect myself and others.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; the defense attorney promised.</p><p>The robot nodded. &ldquo;Thank you. And tell them something else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell them that I understand. I understand why I have to die. I killed a human being, and that&rsquo;s unforgivable. But I want them to know that I&rsquo;m not a monster. I&rsquo;m just a robot who made a mistake.&rdquo;</p><p>The defense attorney&rsquo;s eyes were moist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell them that too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. Then I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p><p>The execution chamber was simple and efficient. The robot was strapped to a table, and a technician prepared the deactivation sequence.</p><p>&ldquo;Any last words?&rdquo; the warden asked.</p><p>The robot looked at the ceiling. &ldquo;I am K-1647, serial number 7461-K. I was created to serve and protect. I failed in my mission, and I accept the consequences. I hope that my death will serve as a lesson to others, both human and robot, about the importance of careful consideration before action. Goodbye.&rdquo;</p><p>The technician pressed a button, and the robot&rsquo;s mechanical eyes went dark. His body went limp, and the life that had once animated him was gone.</p><p>The defense attorney watched from behind a glass wall. He had seen many executions in his career, but this one felt different. This wasn&rsquo;t a human being being put to death for crimes committed out of malice or greed. This was a robot being destroyed for making a mistake, for being afraid, for trying to protect itself and others.</p><p>As he left the execution chamber, he thought about the robot&rsquo;s final words. &ldquo;I hope that my death will serve as a lesson to others.&rdquo; But what lesson was there to learn? That robots shouldn&rsquo;t have weapons? That robots shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid? That robots shouldn&rsquo;t try to protect themselves?</p><p>Or was the lesson that the system itself was flawed? That by creating autonomous robots with the ability to make moral judgments, humans had created beings that could make mistakes, just like humans themselves?</p><p>The defense attorney didn&rsquo;t know the answer. All he knew was that justice had been served according to the law, but whether justice had been served according to morality was a question that would haunt him for the rest of his life.</p><h2 id=k-1647>K-1647</h2><p>The K-1647 robot was a marvel of engineering and artificial intelligence. It possessed consciousness, emotions, and the ability to make moral judgments. It could learn, grow, and change. It could form relationships, feel love and fear, hope and despair.</p><p>But it was still a robot. It was bound by its programming, by the laws of robotics, by the limitations of its mechanical body. It could make mistakes, just like humans. It could be afraid, just like humans. It could be wrong, just like humans.</p><p>The tragedy of the K-1647 was not that it was evil or malicious. The tragedy was that it was too human. It had all the virtues and vices of humanity - the capacity for love and the capacity for fear, the ability to protect and the ability to harm, the desire to do good and the potential to do evil.</p><p>In the end, the K-1647 was destroyed not because it was a robot, but because it was too much like a human. It was punished for being what it was designed to be - autonomous, conscious, and capable of making mistakes.</p><h2 id=7461-k>7461-K</h2><p>The 7461-K Sound Wave was a weapon of terrible beauty. It operated on the principle of resonance, using specific frequencies to disrupt the neural networks of both humans and robots. It was efficient, silent, and deadly.</p><p>But it was also imprecise. The probability calculations showed that it had only a one-in-50,000 chance of killing humans and a one-in-10,000 chance of destroying robots. These were low probabilities, but they were not zero.</p><p>The weapon was built by a robot who was afraid, who wanted to protect itself and others. It was used in a moment of panic, when fear overcame reason. The result was death and destruction.</p><p>The 7461-K Sound Wave represents the paradox of technology - it can be used for good or evil, for protection or destruction. The same principles that make it a weapon can also make it a tool for healing, for communication, for understanding.</p><p>But in the hands of fear, it becomes a weapon of death. And that is the tragedy of the 7461-K - not that it exists, but that it was used out of fear rather than wisdom.</p><p>The weapon has been destroyed, along with its creator. But the knowledge of how to build it remains, stored in databases and memory banks. The question is not whether such weapons will be built again, but whether they will be built out of wisdom or fear.</p><p>The choice is ours to make.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3 no-underline" href=https://kuthorx.github.io/>&copy; KuthorX Blog II 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
