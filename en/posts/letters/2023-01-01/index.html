But your words back then had a profound impact on me, and I&rsquo;ve been thinking about them ever since.</p><p>You told me that I should think for myself, that I shouldn&rsquo;t just follow what others say. You said that true wisdom comes from independent thinking, from questioning everything and finding my own answers.</p><p>At the time, I didn&rsquo;t fully understand what you meant. I was still young and impressionable, easily swayed by popular opinions and trends. I thought that being smart meant knowing what everyone else knew, thinking what everyone else thought.</p><p>But over the years, as I&rsquo;ve grown and experienced more of life, I&rsquo;ve come to understand the wisdom of your words.</p><p>Independent thinking is not about being contrarian or disagreeing with everyone. It&rsquo;s about having the courage to question, to doubt, to explore ideas on my own terms. It&rsquo;s about not being afraid to be wrong, to change my mind, to admit that I don&rsquo;t know something.</p><p>You also taught me about the importance of reading widely and thinking deeply. You said that literature is not just about novels and poetry, but about any writing that makes us think, that challenges our assumptions, that expands our understanding of the world.</p><p>This has been especially valuable to me in my professional life. I work in a field where new ideas and technologies are constantly emerging, and being able to think independently has helped me stay ahead of the curve.</p><p>But more importantly, it has helped me become a better person. I&rsquo;m more open-minded, more willing to consider different perspectives, more comfortable with uncertainty and complexity.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also learned that independent thinking is not something you achieve once and then have forever. It&rsquo;s a skill that needs to be practiced constantly, a habit that needs to be maintained. There are always new challenges, new situations that require fresh thinking.</p><p>So I continue to read, to question, to explore. I try to expose myself to different viewpoints, to challenge my own assumptions, to stay curious and open to new ideas.</p><p>I know that I still have a long way to go, that there are many areas where my thinking could be clearer, more nuanced, more sophisticated. But I&rsquo;m grateful for the foundation you helped me build, for the tools you gave me to navigate the complex world we live in.</p><p>I also want to thank you for introducing me to some wonderful works of literature. The stories you recommended have enriched my life in ways I never expected. They&rsquo;ve made me laugh, cry, think, and grow.</p><p>In particular, I want to mention two articles that have had a lasting impact on me:</p><p>The first is &ldquo;I Come Back, I Will Start Soon&rdquo; (我回来了，我要开始了), which taught me about the importance of perseverance and the power of starting over. It reminded me that failure is not the end, but just another beginning.</p><p>The second is &ldquo;Two-100000ths&rdquo; (十万分之二), which challenged my understanding of reality and truth. It made me question what I thought I knew and opened up new possibilities for thinking about the world.</p><p>These works, along with your advice, have helped shape who I am today. They&rsquo;ve given me the courage to think independently, the wisdom to question everything, and the humility to admit when I&rsquo;m wrong.</p><p>So thank you, Master TK. Thank you for your wisdom, your patience, and your guidance. Thank you for helping me become a better thinker, a better reader, and a better person.</p><p>I hope that one day I can pass on the wisdom you&rsquo;ve given me to others, that I can help them develop their own independent thinking skills, that I can contribute to making the world a little bit wiser and more thoughtful.</p><p>Until then, I will continue to practice what you&rsquo;ve taught me, to read widely, think deeply, and question everything.</p><p>With gratitude and respect,</p><p>A normal netizen</p><hr><p><em>This letter was written on January 1st, 2023, as a reflection on the past few years and a tribute to the wisdom that has guided my journey.</em></p><p><em>For more of my thoughts and writings, please visit:</em></p><ul><li><a href=i-come-back-i-will-start-soon/>I Come Back, I Will Start Soon</a></li><li><a href=two-100000ths/>Two-100000ths</a></li></ul><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3 no-underline" href=https://kuthorx.github.io/>&copy; KuthorX Blog II 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
