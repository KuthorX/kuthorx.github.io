Its permission control design is also very outdated. The author has decided to copy an additional copy, modify it, and publish it here. Please be gentle, dear readers.</p></blockquote><p>Since graduating from high school, I haven&rsquo;t written logs on QQ Space for a long time. Now, on a whim and with inspiration, I want to speak my mind freely, so I&rsquo;m back.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve made many friends on the internet, and I also maintain a few friends in real life. Friends, the recent pandemic has indeed been difficult, and I hope everyone takes care of their health first and looks after those around them.</p><p>When you&rsquo;re free, we can come back and look at the text below, and have a good discussion.</p><h2 id=1-before-university-graduation><strong>1. Before University Graduation</strong></h2><p>Before I graduated from university, I used QQ Space&rsquo;s new &ldquo;archive&rdquo; feature to archive all my posts and logs from before September 1, 2017.</p><p>Looking back now, I may have also been affected by the speed increase and fee reduction that happened around 2017 (referencing tombkeeper&rsquo;s Weibo <a href=https://m.weibo.cn/1401527553/4769417797832257>https://m.weibo.cn/1401527553/4769417797832257</a>). The Chinese internet underwent tremendous changes during this period (in fact, it may have happened earlier than 2017). This change made me feel that speech might no longer be as free as before. The internet in my mind where everyone got along harmoniously—my spiritual sanctuary at the time—<em>seemed, possibly</em> had become a thing of the past.</p><p>The crisis made me feel afraid. Not only was I anxious about work issues as I was about to graduate, but there were also many, many, many life and psychological problems that needed to be resolved. But I still believed that in this chaotic world, knowledge could give me courage.</p><p>During university, I learned various things within my capabilities. There were many hobbies and interests that didn&rsquo;t cost much money and were beginner-friendly, and ultimately, mathematical programming, musical composition, and language writing became my three spiritual foods—perhaps all of these were related to <em>anime culture</em>, which has now been broadly defined but symbolized openness and inclusiveness in my heart.</p><p>I was lucky to make a relatively correct choice when graduating: becoming a worker in the internet industry. On one hand, I did really like programming (maybe not that much), and I enjoyed the &ldquo;controllability&rdquo; that programming gave me; on the other hand, programming gave me more positive feedback. These two aspects complemented each other.</p><p>Programming, in some ways, is like mathematics: for mathematics, as long as you follow the axioms, you can deduce theorems; as long as you follow the theorems, you can know the results of calculations. Objective laws don&rsquo;t change based on subjective human views. Similarly, for programming, as long as you follow how computers operate, then whatever you input, the computer will output to you—it&rsquo;s that simple.</p><p>Of course, after actually understanding programming, I found that only outputting <code>Hello World</code> on the console was something simple to the point of being unable to be simpler. Having not grown up in a first-tier city, I naturally wasn&rsquo;t among the first internet citizens. When I started, I was already far behind many top peers: I was writing <code>Hello World</code>, while others might have already been doing the now-popular AI research.</p><p>But what does that matter? <strong>People more talented than you are also working harder than you, so does that mean your hard work is useless?</strong> I don&rsquo;t agree with this. This is also one of the reasons why I wrote <a href=/posts/fiction/sad-slow-song/>&ldquo;The Slow Lament&rdquo;</a> in high school. <strong>Our early education only looked at each person&rsquo;s grades, ignoring the role of the collective: no matter how excellent one person is, individual ability is limited; only through cooperation between people can better things be accomplished.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, most teachers at that time didn&rsquo;t know how to educate (those of you from the same school who are now grown up, you should know who I&rsquo;m specifically referring to). And due to the tilt of educational resources, the imperfection of the educational system, and other reasons, a very strange phenomenon emerged: students with top grades mostly had extremely poor interpersonal relationships.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to discuss why here (just use a bit of the gray cells Poirot mentioned), I just want to say that my hard work and your hard work are our respective matters, matters of taking responsibility for our respective lives—nothing can force you not to work hard.</p><p>Of course, the current political correctness on the internet is &ldquo;lying flat.&rdquo; I also lie flat, but I lie flat because I&rsquo;m tired and need rest (in fact, I did need rest before), not because I want to lie flat, I don&rsquo;t want to work hard anymore, and hard work is the so-called &ldquo;involution&rdquo; (if anyone really thinks this way, then I suggest you shouldn&rsquo;t continue reading now, otherwise you&rsquo;ll only do some mediocre thinking and then get angry and want to curse me out).</p><p>The internet has made some so-called buzzwords popular and impressive, which unconsciously affects people&rsquo;s understanding of vocabulary. Some netizens, whether they&rsquo;re robots or paid posters or whatever, their single mode of expression is even worse than today&rsquo;s AI (yes, like ChatGPT). Look, isn&rsquo;t this failed education?</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t failed education. Because in some places and some periods, there was no education to speak of. So looking back, although I&rsquo;ve always been sarcastic (well, maybe not always) about the education we received, at least compared to some things I&rsquo;ve seen after graduation, the rules we followed during our student days were already very stable, very simple, and relatively encouraging of people&rsquo;s positive side.</p><h2 id=2-after-university-graduation><strong>2. After University Graduation</strong></h2><p>After graduation, I&rsquo;ve been working for over 4 years now. I&rsquo;ve experienced some big and small things, and recently, due to the pandemic + business trips + work temporarily not being so busy + various other reasons, I can&rsquo;t do anything else, so I have the leisure to say these thoughts late at night.</p><p>Regarding the different colleagues I&rsquo;ve encountered and the overall work environment of the internet industry, I don&rsquo;t want to say much here (I think 4 years isn&rsquo;t enough to observe anything worth detailing). What I want to continue saying is that even in yesterday, which seemed to have developed rapidly, and today, which has slowed down due to 3 years of pandemic growth, China&rsquo;s internet still has a bright tomorrow. The pandemic has brought tremendous changes to the world, and this is the second time I&rsquo;ve felt the wave of the era after the 2017 internet. The wave might swallow people, but it no longer makes me so afraid.</p><p>Soon after the pandemic started, I jumped from one company to another, maintaining a life in a city that, although lacking in cultural depth, was relatively open and economically developed. The new company was quite different from the previous one—everyone was younger, easier to talk to, more open and free—this is what the internet should be like in my mind. I worked here for a while, then based on various reasons (whether personal or collective), I transferred to my current department. The new department is in an even more open and inclusive city, and I feel the situation is better than before.</p><p>Of course, different companies have different departments; and the current department isn&rsquo;t perfect either, it&rsquo;s just suitable for my current state. Whether it&rsquo;s the colleagues I work with or the things we do, I feel very comfortable; there are difficulties, but everyone can overcome them together; there are issues, everyone speaks openly. Work is essentially still one of many human communication methods, so work for me isn&rsquo;t just about making money.</p><p>As I mentioned in <a href=/posts/fiction/sad-slow-song/>&ldquo;The Slow Lament&rdquo;</a>: people are, after all, not machines. People are also not tools. I can understand working people&rsquo;s different attitudes toward different things, but I will also have my own choices, and like programming, slightly anticipate the results of my actions. At least from the current perspective, <em>the deviation of the world line is still within observable range</em>, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>Unrealistic works come from real cries, and world changes come from objective laws. I think that for a long time, the laws of human nature are unchanging, so my methods of dealing with people and situations should also remain unchanged.</p><p>I&rsquo;m very lucky and grateful to have a pair of responsible parents who constantly teach me how to get along with people throughout my life. On one hand, they are teachers, so they know better how to educate their children; on the other hand, <strong>they love me, although sometimes harsh, but that is still a ray of light in winter.</strong></p><p>Of course, I&rsquo;ve also met many friends, regardless of where they come from, we connect and communicate either through reality or through thousands of optical fibers. You are indispensable to my understanding of this world, to this world.</p><p>This article doesn&rsquo;t use any formal literary style. If classified by contemporary literature, it should be considered an essay or miscellaneous writing; if classified by modern entertainment media, it should be considered multiple short Weibo posts spliced together into a long Weibo post. So, if you have opinions about the structure, I&rsquo;ll use a Beatles song title as a reply: Let it be.</p><h2 id=3-now><strong>3. Now</strong></h2><p>Finally, I&rsquo;ll attach a passage from one of my favorite domestic TV dramas, &ldquo;My Own Swordsman,&rdquo; to encourage us all.</p><blockquote><p>Li Dazui: Hey, what do you think you&rsquo;re studying for anyway?</p><p>Lu Xiucai: Initially, I studied for fame and fortune</p><p>Li Dazui: Hey, that&rsquo;s true</p><p>Lu Xiucai: Later, as I read more and more, I felt unsure in my heart. So many books, filling the house</p><p>Li Dazui: Hey hey, you can even read yourself into excitement</p><p>Lu Xiucai: Not excitement—</p><p>Guo Furong: <em>cough cough</em></p><p>Lu Xiucai: —it&rsquo;s excitement, it&rsquo;s excitement. After getting excited, I suddenly realized something</p><p>Lu Xiucai: How to put it? Take making friends for example, you use your heart, not your knowledge</p><p>Lu Xiucai: We study not to show off, but to communicate better</p></blockquote><p>Due to copyright reasons, I can&rsquo;t directly include images, but if interested, you can search: Episode 13 [&ldquo;Li Dazui Pretends to be a Literary Master, Tong Xiangyu Sets Up a Competition to Solve the Crisis&rdquo;] at 17 minutes and 2 seconds.</p><p>After gathering, we will always meet again. Friends, see you next time.</p><pre><code>    — Written on 2022.12.10
