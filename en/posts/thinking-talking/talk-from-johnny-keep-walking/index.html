It&rsquo;s that time again when my mental exhaustion outputs opinions that might offend some glass-hearted people who take things personally (hopefully not).</p><p>First, I need to clarify that this is a reflection on &ldquo;The Annual Meeting Cannot Stop&rdquo; (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Annual&rdquo;), not some year-end summary. If there is any overlap (or complete difference) with your thoughts, please treat it carefully and go easy on me :).</p><p>Last year (strictly speaking, the year before last), I said in <a href=/posts/thinking-talking/i-come-back-i-will-start-soon/>"&lsquo;I&rsquo; Have Returned, But &lsquo;I&rsquo; Will Soon Depart Again"</a> (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Return&rdquo;): &ldquo;Regarding the different colleagues I&rsquo;ve encountered and the overall work environment of the internet industry, I don&rsquo;t want to say much here (I think 4 years isn&rsquo;t enough to observe anything worth detailing).&rdquo;</p><p>Now it&rsquo;s much simpler, because &ldquo;Annual&rdquo; has already said about 70% (roughly) of my observations.</p><h2 id=1-seventy-percent>1. Seventy Percent</h2><p>After watching the movie, my first intuitive feeling was that Hu Jianlin was very lucky to have a group of friends who believed in him and helped him. This was related to his personal charm and his hard work, as well as his circumstances and the era he lived in.</p><p>Most people (based on anecdotal statistics around me) don&rsquo;t have the courage to stand up when they encounter the dark side of the internet workplace (non-internet industries are probably even worse). Even if they do stand up with an excellent mindset, whether they can solve the immediate problem in a wise way, supplemented by the right timing, location, and people (note: the expansion of the dark side is the same), is by no means easy.</p><p>&ldquo;Annual&rdquo; gave me answers to several questions in a dramatic comedic way, exaggerated yet not without awkwardness, but it also left me with more real questions in my heart. These questions make people stop at the right point, make people &ldquo;leave room for reconciliation, good to meet again later&rdquo;—this is compromise without praise or blame. Looking back at the plot progression, if it weren&rsquo;t for the perfectly timed setup in the early stages that put Hu Jianlin at the crossroads where he could make choices, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been so excited at the climactic annual meeting scene in the movie. This is its charm as a movie (so-called long long long video): it gives people valuable thinking and the power not to easily compromise with life.</p><p>Recently, I saw similar subject matter in last year&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elite of Troubles.&rdquo; As a sitcom, while exposing various workplace problems, it also tries to give answers in appropriate or absurd ways. In this, you can also catch a glimpse of some characteristics of today&rsquo;s internet industry: it&rsquo;s still relatively young compared to other industries, but like other industries, it&rsquo;s a mixed bag—this isn&rsquo;t because of anything else, but because of unchanging human nature.</p><h2 id=2-beyond-the-movie>2. Beyond the Movie</h2><p>In &ldquo;Return,&rdquo; I said:</p><blockquote><p>I think that for a long time, the laws of human nature are unchanging, so my methods of dealing with people and situations should also remain unchanged.</p></blockquote><p>Xu Yunfeng in the movie, as one of the core characters in the story, has his own set of rhetoric about this. That rhetoric isn&rsquo;t right or wrong, and you could even say it&rsquo;s not without reason. However, although <em>[&ldquo;characters in stories, whether heroes or villains, always get what they need, never what they want&rdquo;][note1]</em>, there are indeed many similar people who, in different eras, bet correctly on the next wave, became self-defined elites, and lived their lives peacefully.</p><p>The world isn&rsquo;t always fair. An idealist wanting to fight this unfairness alone will, most of the time, either ultimately become a nihilist and die in confusion, or end their own life on an ordinary night. Fortunately, if you&rsquo;re lucky enough, you&rsquo;ll discover that some questions don&rsquo;t need immediate answers; meanwhile, on the road to finding answers, there are always others who can accompany you for a journey long or short, no matter how winding the road.</p><p>For me, living within the situation, it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to distinguish between a person/a group/a symbol/a thought; meanwhile, I find that sometimes people discussing problems can rarely discover solutions because of generalized definitions, even allowing problems to become inaccurate and emotional in expression, thereby worsening the situation, and in serious cases, the entire environment becomes polluted, becoming a footnote in history, warning us who flock to it.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen too many of these things (of course, limited by experience, objectively speaking it&rsquo;s actually not that many), so much so that I sometimes feel despair. &ldquo;After death, who cares about the flood&rdquo; is indeed an attitude that shouldn&rsquo;t be rashly judged, but there should be other perspectives on things, or rather, answers.</p><p>Fortunately, as mentioned in &ldquo;Return,&rdquo; whether online or offline, there are always people who, in their own ways, directly or indirectly give me the power to seek answers. After finding more and more answers, although the questions also increase, my mindset can gradually become stable.</p><p>These things sound quite abstract, but I just don&rsquo;t want to say too many seemingly insincere emotional words outside of the story.</p><h2 id=3-the-story>3. The Story</h2><p>There&rsquo;s a half-joking saying: &ldquo;Drawing pies is actually just telling stories.&rdquo; At first hearing, it seems like an inappropriate analogy. On the other hand, I quite like its converse: &ldquo;Telling stories is drawing pies.&rdquo;</p><p>The output of artistic creation is stories, and I hope I can tell more on mediums other than code in the future. At least in 2023, my mindset wasn&rsquo;t so bad, so in 2024, within observable range, it should continue to maintain this way.</p><p>Thank you for reading this far, and I hope in the new year, everyone stays healthy and mentally resilient :).</p><p>[note1]: From <a href=https://b23.tv/7qdaF4T>&ldquo;The Art of Storytelling&rdquo; Neil Gaiman Masterclass - Bilibili</a></p><pre><code>    — Written on 2024.01.01
