These days I&rsquo;ve been falling through the spacetime hypercube of interstellar travel. My eyes can&rsquo;t see anything clearly, jazz music from all ages echoes in my ears—free, yet unable to make me carefree. Sometimes I take off my headphones to catch the sounds outside. The noise-canceling headphones continue to let the saxophone play every river beside me. The rivers don&rsquo;t intend to push me into the Yangtze, but rather lift me up, and then I&rsquo;m violently slammed down at the doorstep of my hometown in the south.</p><p>I did go home for the Dragon Boat Festival. The plane ticket was bought while the person was alive, but remains in the cloud after their death. Now, at 2 AM, the second day of work, considering I have to work tomorrow, I think I should suddenly interrupt everything and start sleeping.</p><p>Time still laughs heartily at me, thirty thousand days of time flow through my fingers in an instant, yet I still lose memories of the past and future like I do now. I only know the present, a madman pulling at himself. He will sleep, she will wake, but I never close my eyes.</p><p>The chaotic spacetime and redundant pronouns don&rsquo;t demonstrate how brilliant the author is. I still need to practice, constantly deconstructing and constructing, until death greets me and lets me be a proper guest again. The world doesn&rsquo;t need to wait for me to wake up; I will open my eyes with anger, then pretend to casually scatter traces of existence.</p><pre><code>— Written on 2024.6.13
</code></pre><h1 id=2--n>2 / N</h1><p>Last year and this year, May and June, should be somewhat different. Even for someone like me who was once accustomed to anxiety and pain, at this moment, if I said I was already numb, it would seem both bastardly and hypocritical.</p><p>No one wants to have too much contact with negative people and things, so until today, I&rsquo;m still very grateful to those family and friends who know what I&rsquo;ve truly experienced in the past year and are willing to listen or accompany me. Perhaps these aren&rsquo;t the most difficult days of my life, but for me, stuck in a corner, even a thread of connection is enough to make me live happily.</p><p>And to the friends I&rsquo;ve directly or indirectly hurt, I deeply know that the apologies you&rsquo;ve already seen cannot mend the cracks between us. I can only make myself, in the future, try, to work harder at valuing others&rsquo; feelings, especially those I care about. Thank you to those among you who are still willing and able to continue being friends with me.</p><p>As for those appalling malicious acts and ubiquitous stupidity, so far, I still don&rsquo;t have enough strength to fight against them. On one hand, I can&rsquo;t do it alone; on the other hand, I need a long time to think clearly about what the real enemy actually is.</p><p>Patience and unity are still indispensable.</p><p>Before then, I will continue living until the very last moment. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll be lucky enough to see those fortunate ones who think they won&rsquo;t be in the void discover that they&rsquo;ve long been trapped in it. When that time comes, if I&rsquo;m fortunate enough not to be among the void, then I can laugh uproariously at the sky.</p><p>And after that, it&rsquo;s what K-1647 should consider. No era can stop the development of intelligence (you could also say that the development of intelligence is the era itself), nor can it stop the many things that leave moments in our minds. And such moments, if even one can become eternal, then it&rsquo;s worth living for.</p><p>Continue on, so as not to waste this journey.</p><pre><code>— Written on 2025.6.01
